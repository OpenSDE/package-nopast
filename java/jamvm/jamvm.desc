[I] A compact Java Virtual Machine

[T] JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM
[T] specification, second edition (blue book). In comparison to most other VMs
[T] (free and commercial) it is extremely small. However, unlike other small
[T] VMs (e. G. , KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and
[T] includes support for object finalisation and the Java Native Interface
[T] (JNI).
