[I] A little window for running programs, featuring tab completion, history, etc

[T] Gmrun provides a small window which lets you launch programs by typing
[T] their names. It features tab completion similar to bash or Emacs. It
[T] can complete program names from $PATH, or if the command starts
[T] with &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; it will complete file names. It provides a
[T] command history of configurable size, as well as the ability to perform
[T] forward/backward searches through the command history. Gmrun was developed
[T] as a replacement for the Gnome Run program.
