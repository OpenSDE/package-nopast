[I] GTK+ interface builder v3

[T] Glade is a free user interface builder for GTK+ and GNOME.
[T] The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using
[T] the libglade library these can be loaded by applications dynamically
[T] as needed.
[T] (Glade can also generate C code, though this isn't recommended for
[T] large applications.)
[T] By using libglade, Glade XML files can be used in numerous programming
[T] languages including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, C#, Pike, Ruby, Haskell,
[T] Objective Caml and Scheme. Adding support for other languages is easy
[T] too.
