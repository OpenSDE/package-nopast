[I] A CD-ROM reading and control library

[T] This library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and control. Applications
[T] wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and device-dependant properties of a
[T] CD-ROM can use this library. Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE
[T] and NRG is available, so applications that use this library also have the
[T] ability to read disc images as though they were CD's. 
[T] 
[T] Immediate uses are VCDImager, a navigation-capable Video CD plugin and
[T] CD-DA plugin for the media player xine. A sample utility, cdinfo, is
[T] included which displays CD info. If libcddb
[T] (http://libcddb.sourceforge.net) is available, the cdinfo program will
[T] display CDDB matches on CD-DA discs.
