[I] A user shell for restricting remote access to scp and sftp

[T] scponly is an alternative &amp;quot;shell&amp;quot; of sorts for
[T] system administrators who would like to provide access to remote
[T] users to both read and write local files without providing any
[T] remote execution priviledges. Functionally, it is a wrapper around
[T] the ssh suite of applications. It is typically used by creating
[T] a user whose shell is set to scponly. This user can neither login
[T] interactively nor execute commands remotely, but it can use scp and
[T] sftp to download and upload files to the computer, governed by the
[T] usual Unix file permissions.
