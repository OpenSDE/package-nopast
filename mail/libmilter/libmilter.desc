[I] The Sendmail Content Management and Filter API

[T] The Sendmail Content Management API (Sendmail Milter) enables third-party
[T] programs to access mail messages as they are being processed by the Mail
[T] Transfer Agent (MTA). This allows them to examine and modify message
[T] content and meta-information during the SMTP transaction. Any of these
[T] filters can be added or changed independently of other existing Milters.
