[I] An anti spam plugin for the dovecot IMAP server

[T] The dovecot antispam plugin watches a defined spam folder (defaults to
[T] "SPAM"). Instead of moving mail into special folders or forwarding them
[T] to special mail addresses for retraining, the plugin offers two actions
[T] for the user:
[T]
[T] 1. moving mail out of the SPAM folder and
[T] 2. moving mail into the SPAM folder.
[T]
[T] The dovecot plugin watches these actions (and additionally prohibits
[T] APPENDs to the SPAM folder, more for technical reasons than others) and
[T] tells the spam classifier that it made an error and needs to reclassify
[T] the message (as spam/not spam depending on which way it was moved.
