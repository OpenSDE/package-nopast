[I] A server-side anti-spam agent for UNIX email servers

[T] DSPAM is a server-side statistical anti-spam agent for Unix email
[T] servers. It masquerades as the email server's local delivery agent and
[T] effectively filters spam using a combination of de-obfuscation techniques,
[T] specialized algorithms, and statistical analysis. The result is an
[T] administratively maintenance-free, self-learning anti-spam tool. DSPAM
[T] has yielded real-world success rates beyond 99.9% accuracy with less
[T] than a 0.01% chance of false positives.
