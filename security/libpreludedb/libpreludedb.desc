[I] Library that provides easy access to the Prelude database 

[T] The PreludeDB Library provides an abstraction layer upon the type and the 
[T] format of the database used to store IDMEF alerts. 
[T] It allows developers to use the Prelude IDMEF database easily and efficiently 
[T] without worrying about SQL, and to access the database independently of the 
[T] type/format of the database.
