[I] A user level packet filtering suite for Linux

[T] NuFW is an authentication firewall suite: the gateway authorizes a
[T] packet depending on which remote user has sent it. It can also set
[T] quality of service on a per-user basis and log user activities into a
[T] SQL database. Furthermore, it can use an external authentication source
[T] such as an LDAP directory and be the key of a Single Sign On solution.
