[I] The central library for Prelude-IDS framework

[T] Libprelude is the library that provide the framework used to access the
[T] Prelude system. It handles secured communications with one or several
[T] prelude-manager collector, and provides an API (Application Programming
[T] Interface) to create IDMEF (Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format)
[T] based events.
[T] It also provides important features like failover (saving to a local
[T] file for later retransmission, usage of a fallback route), in case one
[T] of the prelude-manager server is down.
[T] Moreover, it gives you the ability to create sensors that read events
[T] received by one or a set of prelude-manager.
[T] You could for example write an interactive notification system using
[T] this feature.
