[I] A Kerberos 5 implementation

[T] Heimdal is an implementation of Kerberos 5 that aims to be protocol
[T] compatible with existing implementations and RFC 1510. It is also
[T] reasonably compatible with the M.I.T Kerberos V5 API, supports Kerberos 5
[T] over GSS-API (RFC 1964), includes a number of important and useful
[T] applications (rsh, telnet, popper, etc.), and is backwards compatible
[T] with Kerberos V4. Kerberos V4 support should not be used if possible
[T] as it has security weaknesses.
