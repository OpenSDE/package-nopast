Description: Do not install gpg-zip manpage

As the 'tools/Changelog' shows, gpg-zip is not installed with gnupg2 because
it gets installed by gnupg. Strangely gnupg2 still tries to install a gpg-zip
manpage which ofcourse conflicts too.

        * Makefile.am (gpg-zip, gpgsplit): Do not install due to a
        conflict with gpg1.
