[I] Collects and normalizes events from Prelude sensors

[T] The Prelude Manager is a high-availability server which collects and
[T] normalizes information from distributed sensors and stores them into
[T] a database (or any kind of user provided media).
[T] It also provides the ability to relay received events to one or several
[T] other prelude-manager servers and to filter received events so that you
[T] can provide specific actions for specific events.
