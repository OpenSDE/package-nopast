[I] A Python library to directly create PDF documents

[T] This free Open Source PDF library is suitable for web publishers, developers
[T] or creative design professionals who need to quickly and easily create or
[T] automate complex (even data-driven) documents. It lets you create
[T] professional documents programmatically without being locked into one
[T] special technology and/or platform. It has grown over years in response
[T] to the real-world requirements of large financial institutions' reporting
[T] needs, making it the trusted proven foundation of existing enterprise
[T] solutions rather than a just a fancy gimmick or interesting library.
