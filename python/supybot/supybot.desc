[I] A robust and user-friendly Python IRC bot

[T] Supybot is a clearly-written Python IRC framework and bot, intended to be
[T] both easily extensible and very flexible. Several modules are included by
[T] default. Numerous plugins are already written, including Google, Factoids,
[T] RSS, Quotes, and Relay. Plugins and their commands achieve greater
[T] utility via command nesting, something that no other IRC bot does. The
[T] user database is based on &amp;quot;capabilities&amp;quot; rather than
[T] obscure flags or arbitrary numeric &amp;quot;userlevels&amp;quot;, giving
[T] the bot flexibility and fine-grained control (think ACLs vs. Standard
[T] *nix permissions). Developing your own additions to the bot is simple
[T] with the base classes provided; writing a new command for the bot is
[T] as simple as writing a function. Unlike many other IRC frameworks,
[T] this simplicity is achieved at no cost to generality, which lets new
[T] programmers and old programmers alike feel at home in the framework.
