[I] A system for finding and configuring WSGI applications and servers. 

[T] For WSGI application consumers it provides a single, simple 
[T] function (loadapp) for loading a WSGI application from a configuration file
[T] or a Python Egg. For WSGI application providers it only asks for a single,
[T] simple entry point to your application, so that application users don't 
[T] need to be exposed to the implementation details of your application.
