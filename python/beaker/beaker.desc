[I] Sessions and Cache for Python

[T] Beaker is a caching library that includes Session and Cache objects 
[T] built on Myghty's Container API used in MyghtyUtils. WSGI middleware is
[T] also included to manage Session objects and signed cookies.
[T] Beaker caching is implemented with namespaces allowing one to store not 
[T] only any Python data that can be pickled, but also multiple versions of 
[T] it by using multiple keys for a single piece of data under a namespace.
