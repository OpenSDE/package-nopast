[I] A GObject based interface to GNOME's system-tools-backends

[T] Liboobs is a lightweight library that provides a GObject based interface
[T] to system-tools-backends. It's completely abstracted of the communication
[T] and authentication details, making it easy for applications to integrate
[T] with the system details.
