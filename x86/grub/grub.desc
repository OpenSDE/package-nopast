[I] The GRand Unified Bootloader

[T] GNU GRUB is a very powerful boot loader, which can load a wide variety
[T] of free operating systems, as well as proprietary operating systems with
[T] chain-loading. GRUB is designed to address the complexity of booting a
[T] personal computer; both the program and this manual are tightly bound
[T] to that computer platform, although porting to other platforms may be
[T] addressed in the future.
[T]
[T] One of the important features in GRUB is flexibility; GRUB understands
[T] filesystems and kernel executable formats, so you can load an arbitrary
[T] operating system the way you like, without recording the physical position
[T] of your kernel on the disk.
