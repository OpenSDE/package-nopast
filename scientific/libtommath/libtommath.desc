[I] A highly optimized and portable for integer based applications

[T] LibTomMath provides highly optimized and portable routines for a vast
[T] majority of integer based number theoretic applications (including
[T] public key cryptography). LibTomMath is not a cryptographic toolkit
[T] itself but it can be used to write one [Used in LibTomCrypt for RSA,
[T] DH and ECC public key routines].
