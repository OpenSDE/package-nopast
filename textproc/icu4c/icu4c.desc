[I] International Components for Unicode (C/C++)

[T] ICU provides a Unicode implementation, with functions for formatting
[T] numbers, dates, times, and currencies (according to locale conventions,
[T] transliteration, and parsing text in those formats). It provides flexible
[T] patterns for formatting messages, where the pattern determines the order
[T] of the variable parts of the messages, and the format for each of those
[T] variables. These patterns can be stored in resource files for translation
[T] to different languages. Included are more than 100 codepage converters
[T] for interaction with non-unicode systems.
