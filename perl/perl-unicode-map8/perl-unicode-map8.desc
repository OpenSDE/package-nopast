[I] Perl module that maps tables between 8-bit character sets and 16 bit

[T] The Unicode::Map8 class implement efficient mapping tables between
[T] 8-bit character sets and 16 bit character sets like Unicode.  About
[T] 170 different mapping tables between various known character sets and
[T] Unicode is distributed with this package.  The source of these tables
[T] is the vendor mapping tables provided by Unicode, Inc. and the code
[T] tables in RFC 1345.  New maps can easily be installed.
[T]
[T] By coincidence Martin Schwartz created a similar module at the same
[T] time I did.  His module is called Unicode::Map and should be available
[T] on CPAN too.  Both modules now support a unified interface.  Martin's
[T] module will be depreciated in the future.
[T]
[T] Since UTF8 support is coming to Perl soon, there might be good reasons
[T] to move this module in the direction of mapping to/from UTF8.  I will
[T] probably do so, once the Unicode support in the Perl core settle.
