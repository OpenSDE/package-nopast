[I] X Render Extension Test Tool

[T] Rendercheck is a program to test a Render extension implementation
[T] against separate calculations of expected output. Tests currently
[T] include:
[T]     - Destination coordinates correctness
[T]     - Source coordinates correctness
[T]     - Transformed (FilterNearest) source coordinates correctness.
[T]     - Composite with and without mask (with/without component alpha),
[T] with 1x1 repeating Pictures and 10x10 Pictures.
[T] Unfortunately, there are currently no command-line arguments to control
[T] its execution. Options, such as verbosity or number of iterations to
[T] encourage pixmap migration, are controlled only in source.
