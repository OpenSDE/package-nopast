[I] A data recovery tool

[T] GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or
[T] block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue
[T] data in case of read errors. GNU ddrescue does not truncate the output
[T] file if not asked to. So, every time you run it on the same output file,
[T] it tries to fill in the gaps. The basic operation of GNU ddrescue is
[T] fully automatic. That is, you don't have to wait for an error, stop
[T] the program, read the log, run it in reverse mode, etc. If you use the
[T] logfile feature of GNU ddrescue, the data is rescued very efficiently
[T] (only the needed blocks are read). Also you can interrupt the rescue at
[T] any time and resume it later at the same point.
