[I] Bootstrap a basic Debian/Ubuntu system

[T] debootstrap is used to create a Debian/Ubuntu base system from scratch,
[T] without requiring the availability of dpkg or apt. It does this by
[T] downloading .deb files from a mirror site, and carefully unpacking them
[T] into a directory which can eventually be chrooted into.
