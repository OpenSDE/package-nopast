[I] MultiTail follows files in style, it is tail on steroids.

[T] MultiTail lets you view one or multiple files like the original 
[T] tail program. The difference is that it creates multiple windows 
[T] on your console (with ncurses). It can also monitor wildcards: 
[T] if another file matching the wildcard has a more recent modification date, 
[T] it will automatically switch to that file.
