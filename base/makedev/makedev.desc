[I] Creates device files for /dev

[T] The MAKEDEV executable is used to create device files, often in /dev.
[T] The /dev tree holds special files, each of which corresponds to a type
[T] of hardware device that Linux supports. This package contains a script
[T] which makes it easier to create and maintain the files which fill a
[T] /dev tree.
[T]
[T] This package isn't used by us, but it's useful when having other
[T] systems virtualized or jailed inside one OpenSDE-based.
