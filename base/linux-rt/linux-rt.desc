[I] The Linux kernel Real-Time branch

[T] The standard Linux kernel does only meet soft-realtime requirements: it
[T] provides basic POSIX operations for userspace time handling but has no
[T] guarantees for hard timing deadlines. With Ingo Molnar's Realtime
[T] Preemption patch (referenced to as RT-Preempt) and Thomas Gleixner's
[T] generic clock event layer with high resolution support, the kernel gains
[T] hard realtime capabilities.
[T]
[T] The RT-Preempt patch has raised quite some interest throughout the
[T] industry. Its clean design and consequent aim towards mainline integration
[T] makes it an interesting option for hard and firm realtime applications,
[T] reaching from professional audio to industrial control.
