[I] An enhanced syslog daemon

[T] Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd.  Among others, it offers
[T] support for on-demand disk buffering, reliable syslog over TCP, writing
[T] to databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and many more), email alerting,
[T] fully configurable output formats (including high-precision timestamps),
[T] the ability to filter on any part of the syslog message, on-the-wire
[T] message compression, and the ability to convert text files to syslog. It
[T] is a drop-in replacement for stock syslogd and able to work with the
[T] same configuration file syntax.
