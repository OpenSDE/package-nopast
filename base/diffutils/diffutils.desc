[I] The GNU collection of diff utilities

[T] You can use the 'diff' command to show differences between two
[T] files, or each corresponding file in two directories.
[T]
[T] You can use the 'cmp' command to show the offsets and line numbers
[T] where two files differ. 'cmp' can also show all the characters that
[T] differ between the two files, side by side.
[T]
[T] You can use the set of differences produced by 'diff' to distribute
[T] updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
[T] This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
[T] to the complete files.
[T]
[T] You can use the 'diff3' command to show differences among three
[T] files. When two people have made independent changes to a common
[T] original, 'diff3' can report the differences between the original and
[T] the two changed versions, and can produce a merged file that contains
[T] both persons' changes together with warnings about conflicts.
[T]
[T] You can use the 'sdiff' command to merge two files interactively.
