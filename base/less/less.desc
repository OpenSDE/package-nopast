[I] A paginator similar to "more" or "pg"

[T] Less is a program similar to more(1), but which allows backward movement
[T] in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does not have to read
[T] the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts
[T] up faster than text editors like vi(1).
