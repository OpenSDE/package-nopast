[I] The multi-precision floating-point library

[T] The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
[T] computations with exact rounding (also called correct rounding). It is
[T] based on the GMP multiple-precision library.
[T]
[T] The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
[T] floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a
[T] well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754
[T] standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit
[T] mantissa).
