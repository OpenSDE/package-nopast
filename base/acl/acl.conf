# Note!
# It seems that upstream developers are (mis)using libexecdir to differentiate
# between /lib and /usr/lib, where development related libraries and symlinks
# should go!
#
# Even if we set --libexecdir=/lib the OpenSDE framework will take care that
# development related libraries and symlinks are correctly installed into
# /usr/lib!
