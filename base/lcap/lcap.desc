[I] Linux Kernel Capability Bounding Set Editor

[T] LCAP allows a system administrator to remove specific capabilities from
[T] the kernel in order to make the system more secure. LCAP modifies the
[T] value in the sysctl file /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound. "Capabilities" are
[T] a form of kernel-based access control. Linux kernel versions 2.2.11 and
[T] greater include the idea of a "capability bounding set," a list of
[T] capabilities that can be held by any process on the system.
