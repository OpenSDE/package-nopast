[I] A unit testing framework for C

[T] Check is a unit test framework for C. It features a simple interface for
[T] defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the developer. Tests
[T] are run in a separate address space, so Check can catch both assertion
[T] failures and code errors that cause segmentation faults or other
[T] signals. The output from unit tests can be used within source code
[T] editors and IDEs.
