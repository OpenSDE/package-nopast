[I] Objective Caml is the latest implementation of the Caml dialect of ML

[T] Objective Caml is an implementation of the Caml dialect of ML extended
[T] with class-based objects and a powerful module system in the style of
[T] SML's. It continues the Caml Light effort in many ways (separate
[T] compilation, low memory requirements, fast turnaround through bytecode
[T] interpretation), but also significantly departs from Caml Light on other
[T] points (objects, the module calculus, and a high-performance native-code
[T] compiler).
