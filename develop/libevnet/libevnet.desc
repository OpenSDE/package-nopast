[I] A network programming interface for libevent

[T] Libevnet provides a suite of interfaces useful in network
[T] applications. The API includes a buffered I/O interface, connect(2)
[T] and accept(2) analogues, a fully featured DNS lookup package, thread
[T] pools, and transparent OpenSSL integration. Using libevent as the
[T] poll-select-epoll-kqueue-/dev/poll event loop, all interfaces express
[T] the traditional Unix non-blocking I/O paradigm for the construction of
[T] high-performance applications.
