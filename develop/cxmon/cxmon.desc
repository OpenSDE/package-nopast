[I] A command-line file manipulation tool and disassembler

[T] Cxmon is an interactive command-driven file manipulation tool inspired
[T] by the &amp;quot;Amiga Monitor&amp;quot; by Timo Rossi. It has commands
[T] and features similar to a machine code monitor/debugger, but it lacks
[T] any functions for running/tracing code. There are, however, built-in
[T] PowerPC, 680x0, 80x86, 6502 and Z80 disassemblers and special support
[T] for disassembling MacOS code. Cxmon is primarily intended for emulation
[T] development but it can be used as a generic tool for manipulating and
[T] analyzing binary data and machine code, or just as a hex calculator.
