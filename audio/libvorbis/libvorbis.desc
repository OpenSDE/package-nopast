[I] Lossless audio compression tools using the ogg-vorbis algorithms

[T] Ogg Vorbis is a fully open, non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free,
[T] general-purpose compressed audio format for mid to high quality
[T] (8kHz-48.0kHz, 16+ bit, polyphonic) audio and music at fixed and
[T] variable bitrates from 16 to 128 kbps/channel. This places Vorbis in
[T] the same competitive class as audio representations such as MPEG-4 (AAC),
[T] and similar to, but higher performance than MPEG-1/2 audio layer 3,
[T] MPEG-4 audio (TwinVQ), WMA and PAC.
