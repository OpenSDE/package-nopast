[I] A flexible Icecast source client with support for external de-/encoders

[T] Ezstream is a command line source client for the Icecast media streaming
[T] server. It can stream Ogg Vorbis and MP3 audio, as well as Ogg Theora
[T] video, either &amp;quot;as-is&amp;quot; without reencoding (which uses
[T] only very little CPU time) or it can use external decoders and encoders to
[T] convert virtually any media format into one of the supported streaming
[T] formats. Ezstream supports metadata, streaming from standard input,
[T] playlists, and external playlist scripts or programs, and more.
