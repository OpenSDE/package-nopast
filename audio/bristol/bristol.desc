[I] A software synthesizer

[T] Bristol is an emulation package for a number of different classic 
[T] synthesizers, including additive and subtractive and a few organs. The 
[T] application consists of the engine, which is called bristol, and its own
[T] GUI library, called brighton, that represents all the emulations. There are
[T] currently twenty something different emulations, each does sound different
[T] although the author maintains that the quality and accuracy of each 
[T] emulation is subjective.
