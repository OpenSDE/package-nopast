[I] A network-transparent, client/server audio transport system

[T] In a nutshell, the Network Audio System (NAS) is the audio equivalent of
[T] an X display server. It was developed by NCD for playing, recording, and
[T] manipulating audio data over a network. Like the X Window System, it uses
[T] the client/server model to separate applications from the specific
[T] drivers that control audio input and output devices.
