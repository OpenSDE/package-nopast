[I] A flexible 3D engine

[T] OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented,
[T] flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and more
[T] intuitive for developers to produce applications utilising hardware-
[T] accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all the details
[T] of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL and
[T] provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes.
