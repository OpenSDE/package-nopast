[I] A C library for some basic image processing operations

[T] leptonlib is a C library for some basic image processing operations. It
[T] provides a full set of affine transformations (translation, shear,
[T] rotation, scaling) on images of all depths is included, with the exception
[T] that some of the scaling methods do not work at all depths. There are also
[T] implementations of binary morphology, grayscale morphology, convolution and
[T] rank order filters, and applications such as jbig2 image processing and
[T] color quantization.
