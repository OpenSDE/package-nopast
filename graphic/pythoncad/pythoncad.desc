[I] A a fully scriptable and customizable CAD program in PyGTK

[T] PythonCAD is a basic 2D drafting program built entirely on Python. The
[T] program currently uses a PyGTK interface, but the design of the program
[T] is such that interfaces using Python bindings to other toolkits such as
[T] PyGNOME, PyQt, and PyKDE could be added. PythonCAD aims to be a fully
[T] featured CAD package, and as it is built on Python it will be very
[T] customizable and scriptable.
