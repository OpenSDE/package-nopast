[I] A GIMP plugin for tileable texture generation via spectral analysis

[T] Fourier Compose is a GIMP plugin, that generates tileable textures, by the
[T] means of a Fourier (spectral) synthesis. In other words, it generates a
[T] random two-dimensional FFT modulus (amplitudes) and random phases, shapes
[T] the modulus by filtering it with specified filters, and performs backwards
[T] FFT. The resulting values are then visualized.
