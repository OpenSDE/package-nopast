[I] A frame buffer based image viewer

[T] Fbida (previously known as fbi) is an image viewer for the Linux console.
[T] Some people -- console veterans included -- might find the idea of viewing
[T] pictures on the console a little bit silly; why not just use X Windows and a
[T] graphical viewer or even a photo editor? The answer to that question varies
[T] from "running X on my server is not an option, but I'd like to be able to view
[T] some pictures while I'm waiting for the compilation of a new kernel to finish"
[T] to "because I can." Pick your excuse.
