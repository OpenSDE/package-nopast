[I] tesseract-ocr language files for German

[T] The Tesseract OCR engine was one of the top 3 engines in the 1995 UNLV
[T] Accuracy test. Between 1995 and 2006 it had little work done on it, but
[T] since then it has been improved extensively by Google and is probably one
[T] of the most accurate open source OCR engines available. Combined with the
[T] Leptonica Image Processing Library it can read a wide variety of image
[T] formats and convert them to text in over 40 languages.
