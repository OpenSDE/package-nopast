[I] GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing.

[T] GraphicsMagick can create new images on the fly, making it 
[T] suitable for building dynamic Web applications. GraphicsMagick 
[T] may be used to resize, rotate, sharpen, color reduce, or add special 
[T] effects to an image and save the result in the same or differing 
[T] image format. Image processing operations are available from the 
[T] command line, as well as through C, C++, Perl, or Windows COM 
[T] programming interfaces.
