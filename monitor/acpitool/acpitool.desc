[I] A versatile command line ACPI client for Linux

[T] AcpiTool is a Linux ACPI client. It's a small command line application,
[T] intended to be a replacement for the apm tool. The primary target
[T] audience are laptop users, since these people are most interested in
[T] things like battery status, thermal status and the ability to suspend
[T] (sleep mode). The program simply accesses the /proc/acpi or /sysfs
[T] entries to get or set ACPI values. A computer running a Linux kernel
[T] from the 2. 4. X or 2. 6. X series with ACPI enabled is needed. It also
[T] supports various extensions for Toshiba, Asus, and IBM Thinkpad laptops.
