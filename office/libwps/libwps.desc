[I] A Microsoft Works file word processor format import filter library

[T] libwps is a library (for use by word procesors, for example) for importing
[T] the Microsoft Works word processor file format. As of December 2006, the
[T] project is new, but it imports Works format versions 2, 3, 4, 5 (aka 2000),
[T] and 8 with some formatting. The scope of this project is just a Works word
[T] processor import filter, so there are no plans for supporting an export
[T] filter, spreadsheets, or databases.
