[I] A cluster/distributed filesystem

[T] GlusterFS is a clustered filesystem capable of scaling to several
[T] petabytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband
[T] RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
[T] system. GlusterFS is based on a stackable user space design without
[T] compromising performance.
