[I] A full CD creation suite for X11

[T] Gnometoaster is a CD authoring application for X11. Create all sorts
[T] of CDs on-the-fly or with precaching in both track-at-once and disc-
[T] at-once mode. Gnometoaster can write mp3 files on-the-fly, create
[T] bootable CDs and has a powerful filesystem editor. CD-Text informations
[T] can be created where supported, automatic cddb lookups make naming your
[T] tracks really easy. Gnometoaster can also be used to convert between
[T] filetypes and encode audio-tracks into mp3 or wav files.
[T] For audio cd the gnome-cd-master tool from cdrdao is the better choice.
