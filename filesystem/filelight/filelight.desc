[I] A compact and recursive graphical representation of your disk usage

[T] Filelight graphically represents a file system as a set of concentric
[T] segmented rings (or nested piecharts), aiming to show where disk space
[T] is being used. Segments expand from the center, representing files and
[T] directories. The size of segments is proportional to the size of the files
[T] they represent. Directories have child segments which represent the files
[T] they contain. Filelight performs a similar function to the command line
[T] tool du, but all the information is shown in a compact graphical fashion.
