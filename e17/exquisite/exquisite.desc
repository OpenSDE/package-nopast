[I] A psplash compatible bootsplash tool using EFL

[T] This is a psplash replacement that is very simple and uses EFL core
[T] components for display - thus having immensely powerful theme abilities
[T] without needing any platform-specific compiled themes or modules.
[T] It is compatible with psplash with the same message commands (and more).
[T] The difference is that it requires libraries like evas, edje, ecore, eet
[T] and embryo. These also have loadable modules of their own - thus this isn't
[T] perfect for systems that can't have these libraries available and working
[T] at boot, but if you can, it's a lot more capable than other splash engines,
[T] while still running in the framebuffer.
