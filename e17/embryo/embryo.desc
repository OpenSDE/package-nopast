[I] A small virtual machine and bytecode compiler

[T] Embryo is a virtual machine and compiler based on the Small programming
[T] language. It has had many bugs fixed and a lot of portability work done
[T] to the engine and the compiler. It has been made smaller and simpler
[T] making it ideal for inclusion into any program wanting to use small pieces
[T] of "script logic" within a more complex system, but don't want to bring
[T] in the massive resources required by other languages.
