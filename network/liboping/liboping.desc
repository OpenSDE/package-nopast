[I] A multiple host ping library that supports ICMPv4 and ICMPv6

[T] Liboping is a C library for measuring network latency using ICMP echo
[T] requests. It can send to and receive packets from multiple hosts in
[T] parallel, which is nice for monitoring applications. Both IPv4 and IPv6
[T] are supported transparently for the programmer and user. A program called
[T] oping is included to show the simplicity and potential of the library
[T] and provide the functionality at the command line.
