[I] An NSS module for name lookups using LDAP

[T] Nss-ldapd is a (glibc) NSS module for doing name lookups to an LDAP
[T] server. This module allows retrieval of information about Unix accounts,
[T] groups, hosts, and other information from an LDAP directory. It is a
[T] fork from the nss_ldap module to do some architectural changes. This
[T] implementation splits the functionality into an NSS part and a local
[T] daemon to do the lookups. This works around a number of problems in the
[T] original implementation.
