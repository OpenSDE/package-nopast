[I] A simple terminal emulator

[T] Dterm is a simple terminal emulator which doesn't actually emulate any
[T] particular terminal. Mainly, it is designed for use with xterm and
[T] friends, which already do a perfectly good emulation. Therefore, it
[T] doesn't need any special help; dterm simply provides a means by which
[T] keystrokes are forwarded to the serial line, and data forwarded from
[T] the serial line appears on the terminal.
