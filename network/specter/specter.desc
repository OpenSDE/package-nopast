[I] A user-space logging facility for netfilter

[T] Specter is a user-space logging facility for the Linux netfilter
[T] system. It uses netfilter's ULOG target to gather packets, and passes
[T] them to attached plugins. Its features a flexible and robust modularized
[T] structure, and is based on ulogd, but has improved design and wider
[T] functionality. It currently supports a basic set of network protocols
[T] (IP, TCP. UDP, and HTTP) and can save data as text or PCAP, or add it
[T] to MySQL or PostgreSQL databases.
