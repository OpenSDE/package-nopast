[I] A small caching DNS proxy and DHCP server

[T] Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP
[T] server. It is designed to provide DNS and (optionally) DHCP to a small
[T] network. It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the
[T] global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows
[T] machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with
[T] names configured either in each host or in a central configuration
[T] file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP
[T] for network booting of diskless machines.
