[I] A collection of network configuration programs for Linux

[T] The net-tools package contains a collection of programs that form the base
[T] set of the NET-3 networking distribution for the Linux operating system.
[T] It contains the important tools for controlling the network subsystem of the
[T] Linux kernel including arp, hostname, ifconfig, netstat, rarp and route.
[T] Additionally it provides utilities relating to particular network hardware
[T] types (plipconfig, slattach), nameif for naming network interfaces based on 
[T] MAC addresses and ether-wake which generates and transmits Wake-On-LAN (WOL)
[T] "Magic Packets", used for restarting machines that have been soft-powered-
[T] down (ACPI D3-warm state).
[T]
[T] Important:
[T] For modern Linux systems most net-tools programs are obsolete now!
[T] It is highly recommended to use the command set provided by the iproute2
[T] package and additional applications like ifrename and ethtool.
