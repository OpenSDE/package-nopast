[I] A library for OS-independent pseudo-TTY management

[T] Libptytty is a small library that offers pseudo-TTY management in an
[T] OS-independent way. It was created out of frustration over the many
[T] differences of PTY/TTY handling in different operating systems for use
[T] inside rxvt-unicode. It also offers session database support (utmp and
[T] optional wtmp/lastlog updates for login shells) and supports forking
[T] after startup and dropping privileges in the calling process.
[T] It offers C++ and C-only APIs.
