[I] An irssi log beautifier

[T] Nudelstats is a parser for irssi log files, producing XHTML output. It
[T] is based on irssistats 0.44, but uses a completely different approach to
[T] themes; they are stored outside the binary, in CSS format. This makes it
[T] slightly less portable, but much easier to change the themes.
