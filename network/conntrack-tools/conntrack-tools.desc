[I] A a set of connection tracking userspace tools for Linux

[T] The conntrack-tools are the userspace daemon so-called conntrackd and a
[T] command line interface known as conntrack. Both tools let system
[T] administrators interact with the Netfilter Connection Tracking System
[T] from userspace.
[T] - The userspace daemon so-called conntrackd covers the specific aspects
[T]   of stateful Linux firewalls to enable high availability solutions.
[T]   It can be used as statistics collector of the firewall use as well.
[T]   The daemon is highly configurable and easily extensible.
[T] - The command line interface (CLI) conntrack provides an interface to
[T]   add, delete and update flow entries, list current active flows in
[T]   plain text/XML, current IPv4 NAT'ed flows, reset counters, and flush
[T]   the complete connection tracking table among many other.
[T]   This tool is intended to replace the /proc/net/nf_conntrack interface.
