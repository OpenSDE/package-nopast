[I] A packet injection and capture tool

[T] Packit is a network auditing tool. Its value is derived from its ability
[T] to customize, inject, monitor, and manipulate IP traffic. By allowing you
[T] to define (spoof) nearly all TCP, UDP, ICMP, IP, ARP, RARP, and Ethernet
[T] header options, Packit can be useful in testing firewalls, intrusion
[T] detection systems, port scanning, simulating network traffic, and general
[T] TCP/IP auditing. Packit is also an excellent tool for learning TCP/IP.
