[I] A secure VPN that allows mesh networking

[T] CloudVPN is a VPN that allows mesh networking. It can create secured
[T] networks with special or weird topologies. All nodes of the network are
[T] equal and can connect in any way, so it's very easy to create connection
[T] schemes with (for example) clustered servers, decentralized servers,
[T] complete topologies for better throughput, ring topologies for failover,
[T] long-line for passing through many routes, or tree topology for optimizing
[T] inter-server bandwidth needs. It is very easy to get working.
