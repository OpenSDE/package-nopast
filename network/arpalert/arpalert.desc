[I] Monitors ethernet networks

[T] Arpalert listens on a network interface (without using 'promiscuous' mode)
[T] and catches all conversations of MAC address to IP request.
[T] Then compares the mac addresses it detected with a pre-configured list of
[T] authorized MAC addresses.
[T] If the MAC is not in list, arpalert launches a pre-defined user script with
[T] the MAC address and IP address as parameters.
