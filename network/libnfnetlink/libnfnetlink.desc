[I] A low-level netlink communication library for netfilter

[T] nibnfnetlink is a low-level userspace library for nfnetlink-based
[T] communication between the kernel-side netfilter and the user-space
[T] world. It is therefore the fundamental layer for all other
[T] nfnetlink-enabled user-space programs interfacing with the netfilter
[T] subsystem of the Linux kernel.
