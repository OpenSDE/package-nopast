[I] An IPv6 router advertisement daemon

[T] The router advertisement daemon (radvd) is run by Linux or BSD systems
[T] acting as IPv6 routers. It sends Router Advertisement messages, specified
[T] by RFC 2461, to a local Ethernet LAN periodically and when requested by a
[T] node sending a Router Solicitation message. These messages are required for
[T] IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration.
