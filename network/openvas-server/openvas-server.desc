[I] OpenVAS Server

[T] OpenVAS stands for Open Vulnerability Assessment System.
[T] The OpenVAS Server is the core application of the OpenVAS project. It is a
[T] scanner that runs many network vulnerabilitiy tests against many target
[T] hosts and delivers the results. It uses a communication protocol to have
[T] client tools (graphical end-user or batched) connect to it, configure and
[T] execute a scan and finally receive the results for reporting.
[T] Tests are implemented in the form of plugins which need to be updated to
[T] cover newest identieifed security issues.
