Author: Christian Wiese <morfoh@opensde.org>
Upstream Status: Problem was reported long time ago, but for the author it
                 doesn't seem to be a problem that has to be addressed.
Description: Both, argus and argus-clients do install the 'argusbug' script
             supposed to be used for bug reporting.
             Because installing the same file by 2 different packages is against
             OpenSDE policy we do check for its existence before we are going
             to install it or not.
