Upstream Status: submitted
Origin: evms-2.5.5-configure-ncurses-libs.patch by Christian Wiese made for the
Open System Development Environment (http://opensde.org)
Description: Fixes the check for new_panel function within the configure script.
	     The EVMS configure script does not save -lncurses into LIBS if
	     ncurses was detected. As side effect the check for the new_panel
	     function doesn't link against -lncurses which lets the test fail
	     even if new_panel is available within -lpanel.
