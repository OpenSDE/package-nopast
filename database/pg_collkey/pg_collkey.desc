[I] International UTF-8 collation for PostgreSQL

[T] Pg_collkey is a wrapper to use the collation functions of the ICU library
[T] with a PostgreSQL database server. Using this wrapper, you can specify
[T] the desired locale for sorting UTF-8 strings directly in the SQL query,
[T] rather than setting it during database installation. Default Unicode
[T] collation (DUCET) is supported. You can select whether punctuation should
[T] be a primary collation attribute or not. The level of comparison can be
[T] limited (in order to ignore accents, for example). Numeric sequences of
[T] strings can be recognized, so that 'test2' sorts before 'test10'. This
[T] library is dependent on ICU.
