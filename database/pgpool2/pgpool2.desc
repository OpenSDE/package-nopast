[I] A connection pool server for PostgreSQL

[T] pgpool is a connection pool server for PostgreSQL. pgpool runs between
[T] PostgreSQL's clients(front ends) and servers(back ends). A PostgreSQL
[T] client can connect to pgpool as if it were a standard PostgreSQL server.
[T] pgpool caches the connection to PostgreSQL server to reduce the overhead
[T] to establish the connection to it.
