[I] A network interface for Tokyo Cabinet

[T] Tokyo Tyrant is a package of network interface to the DBM called Tokyo
[T] Cabinet. Though the DBM has high performance, you might bother in case
[T] that multiple processes share the same database, or remote processes
[T] access the database. Thus, Tokyo Tyrant is provided for concurrent and
[T] remote connections to Tokyo Cabinet. It is composed of the server process
[T] managing a database and its access library for client applications.
[T]
[T] The server features high concurrency due to thread-pool modeled
[T] implementation and the "epoll" mechanism of the modern Linux kernel.
[T] The server and its clients communicate with each other by simple binary
[T] protocol on TCP/IP. Protocols compatible with memcached and HTTP/1.1 are
[T] also supported so that almost all principal platforms and programming
[T] languages can use Tokyo Tyrant.
