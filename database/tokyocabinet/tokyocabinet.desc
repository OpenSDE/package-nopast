[I] A modern implementation of a DBMS

[T] Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. It is the
[T] successor of QDBM. Tokyo Cabinet runs very fast. For example, the time
[T] required to store 1 million records is 1. 5 seconds for a hash database
[T] and 2. 2 seconds for a B+ tree database. Moreover, the database size
[T] is very small. For example, the overhead for a record is 16 bytes for
[T] a hash database, and 5 bytes for a B+ tree database. Furthermore, the
[T] scalability of Tokyo Cabinet is great. The database size can be up to 8EB.
