[I] Lua Web Server API

[T] WSAPI is an API that abstracts the web server from Lua web applications.
[T] By coding against WSAPI your application can run on any of the supported
[T] servers and interfaces (currently CGI, FastCGI and Xavante, on Windows
[T] and UNIX-based systems).
[T]
[T] WSAPI provides a set of helper libraries that help with request processing
[T] and output buffering. You can also write applications that act as filters
[T] that provide some kind of service to other applications, such as
[T] authentication, file uploads, request isolation, or multiplexing.
[T]
[T] WSAPI's main influence is Ruby's Rack framework, but it was also
[T] influenced by Python's WSGI (PEP 333). It's not a direct clone of either
[T] of them, though, and tries to follow standard Lua idioms.
