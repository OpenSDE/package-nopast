[I] A simple interface to start programs and control them via a pty for Lua

[T] lpty is a module that allows a program written in lua to open the master
[T] side of a PTY and start a program with the slave side of the PTY as its
[T] controlling terminal. The PTY may then be read from and written to, thus
[T] controlling the remote program.
