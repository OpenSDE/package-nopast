[I] Coroutine-safe xpcall and pcall versions for LUA

[T] Coxpcall encapsulates the protected calls with a coroutine based loop,
[T] so errors can be dealed without the usual pcall/xpcall issues with
[T] coroutines.
[T]
[T] Using Coxpcall usually consists in simply loading the module and then
[T] replacing Lua pcall and xpcall by copcall and coxpcall.
