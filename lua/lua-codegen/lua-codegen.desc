[I] A template engine for lua inspired by StringTemplate

[T] lua-CodeGen is a "safe" template engine that enforces a strict
[T] Model-View separation. Only 4 primitives are supplied:
[T]  * attribute reference,
[T]  * template include,
[T]  * conditional include,
[T]  * and template application (i.e., map operation).
[T]
[T] lua-CodeGen allows to split template in small chunk, and
[T] encourages the reuse of them by inheritance.
