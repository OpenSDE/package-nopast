[I] A documentation generator for lua source code

[T] LuaDoc is a documentation generator tool for Lua source code. It parses the
[T] declarations and documentation comments in a set of Lua source files and
[T] produces a set of XHTML pages describing the commented declarations and
[T] functions.
[T] The output is not limited to XHTML. Other formats can be generated by
[T] implementing new doclets. The format of the documentation comments is also
[T] flexible and can be customized by implementing new taglets.
