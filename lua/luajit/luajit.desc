[I] A Just-In-Time Compiler for Lua

[T] LuaJIT implements the full set of language features defined by Lua 5.1.
[T] The virtual machine (VM) is API- and ABI-compatible to the standard Lua
[T] interpreter and can be deployed as a drop-in replacement.
[T] LuaJIT offers more performance, at the expense of portability.
[T] It currently runs on all popular operating systems based on x86 or x64
[T] CPUs (Linux, Windows, OSX etc.) or embedded systems based on ARM (Android,
[T] iOS) or PPC/e500v2 CPUs.
