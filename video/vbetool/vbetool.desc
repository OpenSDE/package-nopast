[I] A tool to run real-mode video BIOS code to alter hardware state

[T] Vbetool uses lrmi in order to run code from the video BIOS. Currently,
[T] it is able to alter DPMS states, save/restore video card state, and
[T] attempt to initialize the video card from scratch. It exists primarily
[T] in order to increase the chances of successfully recovering video state
[T] after an ACPI S3 suspend.
