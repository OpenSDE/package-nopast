[I] A modified QEMU for Linux KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine)

[T] qemu-kvm provides a modified Linux KVM specific version of the QEMU
[T] emulator, which is needed to run KVM guest systems.
[T] KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution
[T] for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (AMD-V or
[T] Intel VT).
[T] KVM consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core
[T] virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko
[T] or kvm-amd.ko, which are included in the Linux Kernel as of version 2.6.20.
[T] Using KVM, one can run multiple virtual machines running unmodified Linux
[T] or Windows images. Each virtual machine has private virtualized hardware:
[T] a network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.
